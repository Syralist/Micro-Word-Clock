Please read the notes in the [parent folder](https://github.com/formatc1702/Micro-Word-Clock/tree/master).

The RTClib.cpp and RTClib.h files can be placed into your Arduino sketchbooks's library/ folder for use in other projects as well.

Please download Carlos Rodrigues' Barebones ATmega Chips board configuration file:
https://github.com/carlosefr/atmega (instructions inside)

The boards.txt file is not needed for newer Arduino IDE versions that include the Boards Manager (under Tools -> Board).

For old versions of the Arduino IDE, it should be placed into a subfolder inside the hardware/ folder of your Arduino sketchbook. E.g. hardware/barebones/boards.txt.

RTClib code by [JeeLabs](http://jeelabs.org) released to the public domain.
